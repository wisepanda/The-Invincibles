##Hi SOC!!##
I am super excited to finally present my first project just on the finish line before the bootcamp starts on Monday!
I chose the Arsenal's invincibles because they were the team that made me fall in love with the premier league, even though I've always supported Liverpool :sweat_smile:
Enjoy the read and the goals, there's some beauties there!
See you monday!
Ivan

## Hi Schoole of code!! 
After struggling for a couple of days with GitHub I finally manged to upload my tribute page!
I am not sure if I have done it the right way as I have uploaded the html file through the website and not the command line, but I feel satisfied for the work done!
I have really enojoyed learning html and css, I really feel like I'm starting to grasp the principles, and excersising every day (unfortunately working I haven't been able yet)
I will just get better and better. I know the struggle will be real, I can already see it, but I  for feel ready for it.
I hope you will enjoy the content!

## My First Project

As a requirement to enter School of Code's bootcamp we had to create a static tribute page with HTML and CSS.

I chose the Arsenal Invincibles because they were the team that made me fall in love with the Premier League when I was a kid and creating this page has been a way of learning more about this incredible story.

This was the very first time I ever coded, used github pages, HTML and CSS.

Below, the first readme written when delivering the project.

## Hi Schoole of code!! 
After struggling for a couple of days with GitHub I finally manged to upload my tribute page!
I am not sure if I have done it the right way as I have uploaded the html file through the website and not the command line, but I feel satisfied for the work done!
I have really enojoyed learning html and css, I really feel like I'm starting to grasp the principles, and excersising every day (unfortunately working I haven't been able yet)
I will just get better and better. I know the struggle will be real, I can already see it, but I  for feel ready for it.
I hope you will enjoy the content!
